# AccordionSolitaire

Accordion Solitaire is the first version of solitaire I ever learned, and it's still my favorite. I originally made this game over a weekend about a month too late for Ludum Dare 50, though the "Delay the Inevitable" theme was my inspiration.
The game is downloadable on from itch.io at [this link](paetramon.itch.io/accordion-solitaire).
